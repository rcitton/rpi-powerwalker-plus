# PowerMaster+ Docker container

Runs PowerMaster+ UPS management software from a Docker container. 
Original idea from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/13pnjnm/powerwalker_ups_powermaster_software_in_docker/) and Fredrik Jönsson (see https://github.com/fjollberg/rpi-powerwalker-plus)


## PowerMaster+

PowerMaster is the controller software for [BlueWalker/PowerWalker](https://powerwalker.com/)
UPS devices.

The software is organised in a "Local" component, typically run on a computer with
a USB-connection with the UPS device, and a "Remote" component, run on all other
hosts which listens to UPS events "Local" broadcasts.

This container provides the "Local" service.
